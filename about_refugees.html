		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Refugees are individuals and families who are forced to flee their home due to war, persecution, and other crises. Worldwide, over 60 million people have been displaced refugees. In Utah alone, the refugee population is diverse. According to Utah Refugees Connection, the 65,000 refugees living in Utah come from over 40 countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia, Sudan, and Ukraine, and speak well over 20 languages. Today, roughly half the world's refugees are children, some of them unaccompanied by an adult, a situation that makes them especially vulnerable to child labor or sexual exploitation.</p>

		<p>  Benedetta Berti and Evelien Borgman gave an excellent seminar on Ted-Ed in 2016 outlining what it means to be a refugee. In addition to outlining their journeys as being "long and perilous with limited access to shelter, water, or food", they also outline how the troubles of a refugee continue after they flee from their home country. These include being the victims of inconsistent and discriminatory treatment,xenophobia and racism. In addition, too many refugee children are out of school due to lack of funding for education programs.

		<p>From Dooa al Zamel's autobiography "A Hope More Powerful Than the Sea" <br><blockquote><i>"Refugees will not risk their lives on such a dangerous jounrey if they could thrive where they were. Migrants fleeing poverty would not thrust themselves into the unkown if they could feed themselves and their children at home." </i></blockquote>It is apparent that a refugee, leaving nearly all possesions and their homes due to the most dire of circumstances and require our assistance to begin a new safe life. </p>
